          <blockquote cite="http://">
            As a teacher and an artist, to me diversity is something that evokes wonder, provokes profound questioning, inspires thoughtful response and the desire to celebrate the human condition.  It is at once differences and universality.  I see it as a great poem in which true meanings exist in the spaces between.  It is the maddening juxtaposition:  We are all very different yet at once the same.</p>

        <p><strong>Organizing and hosting responsibilities are rotated every year among three universities (Ball State University, Indiana State University, and Indiana University Southeast). In selecting the symposium's theme, keynote speakers, and activities, the organizers highlight the diversity-related values and objectives at their respective institutions while achieving the goals of the DRS. </strong></p>

        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>The diversity research symposium aims to accomplish two things:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>  To provide an educational environment in which faculty, staff, community members, and students from all disciplines who are interested in cultural diversity issues can learn, interact, share ideas, and network with one another.</li>
          <li>  And to encourage members of academic institutions to infuse cultural diversity issues into their research, curricula, and professional development.  </li>
        </ul>
